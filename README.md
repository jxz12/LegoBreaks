Inspired by Lego Masters, Series 2 Episode 2: Drop test.

This git repo does not contain the Lego-specific assets. To get everything together, FIRST clone this repo, then import the assets at [link](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/lego-microgame-179847), WITHOUT overwriting the ProjectSettings folder.

Controls (TODO add to UI):
 - move mouse to choose where to place brick
 - left-click places a brick, right-click spins camera 90 degrees
 - A and D spin the brick anti-clockwise and clockwise, respectively
 - S and W undo and redo the last moves, respectively
